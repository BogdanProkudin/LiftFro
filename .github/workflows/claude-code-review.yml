# visual progress tracking for PR reviews, similar to v0.x agent mode.

            Perform a comprehensive code review with the following focus areas:

            1. **Code Quality**
               - Clean code principles and best practices
               - Proper error handling and edge cases
               - Code readability and maintainability

            2. **Security**
               - Check for potential security vulnerabilities
               - Validate input sanitization
               - Review authentication/authorization logic

            3. **Performance**
               - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
               - Review database queries for efficiency
               - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

            4. **Testing**
               - Verify adequate test coverage
               - Review test quality and edge cases
               - Check for missing test scenarios

            5. **Documentation**
               - Ensure code is properly documented
               - Verify README updates for new features
               - Check API documentation accuracy

            For every issue found, assign a severity level:
            - 🔴 CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, eval, hardcoded secrets/credentials, missing auth/authz, remote code execution, path traversal)
            - 🟠 HIGH: Bugs that will cause runtime errors, data loss, or corruption; `any` types; missing input validation on API boundaries; unhandled promise rejections; race conditions
            - 🟡 MEDIUM: Bad practices, poor error handling, performance issues, missing types, code smells
            - 🟢 LOW: Style issues, naming, minor suggestions, documentation gaps

            Provide detailed feedback using inline comments for specific issues. Prefix each inline comment with the severity emoji.

            IMPORTANT: If you find ANY 🔴 CRITICAL or 🟠 HIGH issues, you MUST exit with a non-zero exit code by running: exit 1
            If there are only 🟡 MEDIUM and 🟢 LOW issues (or no issues), exit normally.
